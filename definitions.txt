* External properties
lambda     : average arrival rate
1/lambda   : average time between arrivals

* Properties of a server (independent of traffic)
S     : size of a job - how long does it take to process in absence of other jobs
E[S]  : expected service time
mu    : average service rate

* Properties of a system (server + traffic)
T     : response time
E[T]  : mean response time
T_q   : waiting/queuing time
N_q   : number of jobs in the queue
N     : number of jobs in the system
rho_i : Device utilization of device i (fraction of time busy)
X_i   : Throughput of device i (rate of completions)

* Closed-system specific
Z     : think time (time between receiving end of 1 job and starting a new one)
R     : response time (time it takes system to do the work)
T     : system time


Equations:
* Open-system
E[T] = E[Tq] + E[S] (response time = queuing time + compute time)

* Closed-system
E[T] = E[R] + E[Z]

mu = 1/E[S]
X_i = mu_i * rho_i (service_rate * utilization = throughput)
rho_i = X_i * E[S] (Utilization Law) (utilization = throughput * compute time)
