lambda: average arrival rate
1/lambda: average time between arrivals
S: size of a job - how long does it take to process in absence of other jobs
E[S]: expected service time
mu = 1/E[S] : average service rate
T: response time
E[T]: mean response time
T_q: waiting/queuing time
N_q: number of jobs in the queue
N: number of jobs in the system
rho_i: Device utilization of device i (fraction of time busy)
X_i: Throughput of device i (rate of completions)

Equations:
E[T] = E[Tq] + E[S] (response time = queuing time + compute time)
X_i = mu_i * rho_i (service_rate * utilization = throughput)
rho_i = X_i * E[S] (Utilization Law) (utilization = throughput * compute time)
